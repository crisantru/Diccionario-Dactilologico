The following are configuration for git and nginx

nginx was installed mostly through these directions:

And configured for Catalyst and fastcgi with mostly these directions:

The multiple git locations was a tip found on the openshift forums.

Some variables need to be changed.

rhc ssh name-of-your-app

echo $OPENSHIFT_DIY_IP
echo $OPENSHIFT_DIY_PORT
echo $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR
echo $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR

and make a note of these. If you started off with a cartridge that wasn't diy, exchange the diy for whatever cartridge you chose. $OPENSHIFT_DIY_* is $OPENSHIFT_PERL_*.o

The first url has a sample script for exchanging these variables, but I just did it once in the config files.

In the git config the url should be changed from url = ssh://522dc4105973ca71150000e2@test-advcomp.rhcloud.com/~/git/test.git/ to your application.
