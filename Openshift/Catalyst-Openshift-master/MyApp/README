The server should startup upon pushing to your openshift directory

test it at http://nameofapp-nameofdomain.rhcloud.com/myapp/hello

You should see a few css rules in there - notably that MyApp in in blue found with a gray background.

also test it at /myapp/form to make sure form data is being returned correctly.

I also prefer to use the log4perl and catalyst combo, but I haven't set that up here.
